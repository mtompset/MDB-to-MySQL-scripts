# MDB-to-MySQL-scripts
Scripts and configuration files which take an MS Access MDB file and convert it to a MySQL database

## Requirements
This set of scripts needs an Access MDB file.
This set of scripts needs docker-compose and docker installed.

## General Use
docker-compose up -d  
docker-compose exec db bash -c "cd /data; ./mysql_export.sh {access database name} {MySQL DB name}"

## Generated File: SQL-files.tar
This is generated by the script. It contains all the SQL scripts
necessary to generate the MySQL Database, Tables, and then populate
them.

## Additional Files

### field_types.remap
This file is used to remap the expected type of a field. For example,
Text (100) might be used instead of Date, but by looking at all the
data, it is obvious it is a Date.
{field name}: {data type}: {new data type}
The spaces are important. Without them a field like "Adjust_Text" might
turn into "Adjust_VARCHAR".

### fix_*.sql
These are post processing SQL scripts to run. This is particularly
useful if someone's name is typed many different ways, but it should
only be one way.
